## FPGA Design meeting (01/03/2024)
- Wanna talk about the project as a whole 
- Justin and Dylan tell us what's needed.
	- Basic flight and experiment details
- Update on the current FPGA/RP state
- Work on:
	- Design specs
	- Testing specs
---
## Current progress - Hasith

- Red Pitaya basic system
	- Arm + FPGA (Xilinz Zynq series)
	- We have 2 versions: SDR lab and STEM lab. refer specs for difference
	- All my work so far has been on the SDR lab board
- What I know so far
	- Python control
		- LEDs and Digital pins
		- DAC ramp using (slow pins): we need to resolve the conflict here of why and what should be used. 
	- FPGA direct
		- you need 2020.1 to compile source I have upgraded the project to 2022.1
		- LED access 
		- Isolate DAC pins. can't drive them yet
---
## Questions for every one

- How are we going to approach collaboration between multiple developers(On Matlab)
	- Independent development and try to combine later ?
		- Runs the risk of not being able to fit in one FPGA
- Finalize a requirement and test plan document
- Testing: can this be done by some one else ? 
	- I might not have access to all the systems right now.
- [ ] What Xilinz Zynq do we have on the RP STEM? #task #Dylan

## Things to be done
- Integration testing
- Red Pitaya Testing
	- Processing of saved data
		- How are we viewing the saved data from the Red Pitaya
	- Preamp Testing
		- implement way to characterize preamps in the code
	- Sweep
		- Frequency Sweep too slow, switch to C?
		- Calibrate Frequency Sweep after preamp?
		- Evaluate Sweep time, rate, save data simultaneously?
	- Random Noise
		- Casper
			- Can we generate PWM signals?
			- Software controlled Antenna?
			- Can we control GPIO pins?
			- Can we communicate in SPI?
			- Can we save ADC data to file?
			- Python API?
	- Main Code
		- Write a main code in C
	- [x] Deployment Limit Switches #task #Hasith âœ… 2024-05-14
		- [ ] Made a new bin `test23.bin` available with gpio input `Limit_low_0`
		- Needs tested if the led 7 is indicating the switch status of the pin
		- Mods to the stop value to be a 50% PWM
		- let Hasith know if it works. upload instructions can be found 
- Tx/Rx Preamp
	- Build
	- Test
		- VNA
		- Construct in parts to see where noise comes in
- LP
	- SPI
		- How quick is the sweep?
		- What is the step size?
	- Get shop to build peek plastic ends
	- Construct full Antenna
- Deployment
	- Mount Deployment to Payload deck
	- Test distance of antenna deployment and proper extension and retraction
	- Ensure gears do not slip
- File Formatting
	- What data products do we want?
