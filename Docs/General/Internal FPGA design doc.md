		- Can the motors be matched to exactly 50% 
			- Yes, there is a band width of about 0.06% duty cycle that the servo will not rotate
		- What is the freq for the PWM
			- The documentation says 50 Hz
		- What is the duty cycle: 
			- Extension: 
				- For servo 1 it is 6.9%
			- Retraction:
				- For servo 1 it is 7.68%
			- Hold: 
				- For servo 1 it is 7.24%
